functionality.

1. Fork this repository to your own Github.
1. Clone it to your machine.
1. Complete each of the challenges described below.
1. Add and commit your changes, pushing them up to your Github.
1. Create a pull request of your solution back to the original repository.
1. Submit a link to your pull request to complete the assessment.

---

## `challenge1.test.ts`

There are 3 bugs, one in each test, that will cause the test to fail or error
out.

- 2 of the bugs are in this test file.
- 1 of the bugs is in one of the page object methods.

Fix the bugs so that the tests run correctly, passing.

---

## `challenge2.test.ts`

These tests checks for palindromes successfully.

Add an additional .json file and set of tests in this file for testing
non-palindromes.

---

## `challenge3.test.ts`

Currently, no tests check the Sum widget.

Add tests in this file, and methods to the `Widgets` page object, that will
validate that sums work.

---

## `stretch.test.ts`

If you are concerned about completing one of the above challenges, you can also
add tests that identify bugs in the application here.

At least two bugs should be located by these tests to offset an incomplete or
incorrect challenge.
